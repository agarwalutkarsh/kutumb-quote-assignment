## Project Overview
This project is a frontend application built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Material UI and Axios to interact with the provided APIs for user authentication, quote creation, and retrieval of quotes and generating media url. The application is designed to be responsive and optimized for mobile devices.

## Live Demo
ðŸš€ The project is hosted on vercel and live ðŸš€. Go to [Project Demo](https://kutumb-quote-assignment.vercel.app/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Running Locally In Development Mode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agarwalutkarsh/kutumb-quote-assignment.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Features
- Login page - Enables user to login using username and otp
- Quote List Page -
    1. Displays paginated list of quotes
    2. Displays a image stored in mediaUrl with overlay text over the image
